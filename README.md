## A protoype of a Flat File CMS

This project is a proof of concept for a json backed react website. This demo stores an entire website<sup>1</sup> as a single json file, allowing for cheap hosting costs even when thousands of websites are hosted.

## Admin panel
This demo uses [tinaCMS](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms) to provide an admin GUI for modifying the json file.

<sup>1</sup>  The websites content is stored in a single json file but theme/image/video assets are stored via other alternative storage
